## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js & npm
-   Python 3.8+
-   PostgreSQL

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhaveshburad729/tronix365.git
cd tronix365
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/tronix365
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```
**Run Server:**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ..
npm install
```
**Configure Environment:**
Create a `.env` file in the root folder:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
**Run Client:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Admin Tools (Backend)
The system includes powerful scripts to manage the event:

**A. Seat Management:**
Update the total seat count and reset the booked counter.
```bash
python update_seats.py
```

**B. Coupon System (Chain Reaction):**
Reset all coupons and generate the first code.
```bash
python reset_coupons.py
```
*   **How it works**:
    1.  Run the script to get the first code.
    2.  Give it to a student.
    3.  When used, the system **automatically generates a new code** and emails it to the admin.
    4.  Repeat the cycle.

---

## 🚀 Deployment
-   **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify.
-   **Backend**: Deploy to Render/Railway/AWS.
-   **Database**: Use a managed PostgreSQL instance (e.g., Supabase, Neon).
